\maketitle
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Who has to do freshmen service points?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item If you are a freshman at Duncan, you must do freshman service points!
		\item f you have special needs (like you don’t want to work around alcohol) make sure you take appropriate opportunities early
	\end{compactitem}
	\item What is a service point?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item A service point is awarded for a pre-approved service to Duncan College, usually through one of our committees.
		\item Service points are loosely weighted according to duration and required effort.
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item Most service point opportunities are worth 1-2 points.
		\end{compactitem}
		\item Service to Rice or the larger community is great, but doesn’t count towards Duncan College credit.
	\end{compactitem}
	\item How many do I need?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item There are two service point thresholds.
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item You need 2 points in order to be eligible to enter room jack in the spring.
			\begin{compactitem}
				\item This means you are automatically kicked off campus yoursophomore year if you don’t have 2 points by the end of February.
			\end{compactitem}
			\item You need 5 points in order to earn your Freshman point for room draw inearly April.
			\begin{compactitem}
				\item This means if you don’t get 5 points then you will select your roomafter everyone else for every year you are at Duncan until youcomplete your points or graduate.
			\end{compactitem}
		\end{compactitem}
	\end{compactitem}
	\item What if I’m a scholarship athlete?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Since we cannot kick scholarship athletes you are guaranteed a room regardless of how many points you do. However, you will still select your room last until you complete 5 points.
	\end{compactitem}
	\item How do I know about opportunities?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item All opportunities will be announced via the Duncan listserve and will be availableon a first come first serve basis.
	\end{compactitem}

	\item What happens if I sign up for an opportunity and then don’t show up?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item  We really need to be able to depend on you if you sign up! If you are a no-show you will lose the points you would have gained. It is possible to have negative points.
	\end{compactitem}

	\item How do I know how many I have?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item There will be a publicly viewable Google doc spreadsheet that will show exactlywho has completed how many points
	\end{compactitem}

	\item What do I do once I've completed 5 points?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Sit back, relax, and find other ways to help out around Duncan!
	\end{compactitem}

	\item What if I want more information?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item You can read the official Duncan Constitutional article at http://bit.ly/Q1ARfw.
		\item If you have further questions please ask an upperclassman or contact me (Gage Wright, your friendly Legislative Vice President) at dunc.lvp@gmail.com.
