Repository of Official Duncan College Government Documents

This Repositor was made in an effort to move our residential college government official forms from subversion to git in an
effort to provide a better platform for students to visualize the evolution of the documents over time.

This movement was successful though this repository itself was only a demo and the actual files can be found at duncan_college/constitution

A further effor will be made to standardize this practice across all residential colleges at rice to bring uniformity to the 
legislation that coverns student body and provide an efficient means for individuals to effect the government that represents them.
